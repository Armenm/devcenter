You can deploy your Android apps to [Huawei AppGallery ](https://appgallery.huawei.com/)via a verified Bitrise Step called **Deploy to Huawei App Gallery**. The Step can be used to deploy any APK file that you build on Bitrise.

## Before using the Deploy to Huawei AppGallery Step

Before you start using the **Deploy to Huawei App Gallery** Step to deploy your apps, you need to do a couple of things:

* [Manually upload the first APK of the app to Huawei AppGallery using the website interface on AppGallery Connect.](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/distribution/app/agc-create_app)
* [Create a team-level API client on AppGallery Connect](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/distribution/app/appgallerykit-createapiclient).

The Step will need:

* The App ID of the app.
* The Client ID of the API client.
* The Key generated for the API client.

## Configuring deployment to Huawei AppGallery

To successfully deploy your app to Huawei AppGallery, you need a Workflow that:

* Builds and [signs an APK file](/code-signing/android-code-signing/android-code-signing-using-bitrise-sign-apk-step/).
* Includes the **Deploy to Huawei App Gallery** Step to deploy the app.

If you did not [manually upload your first APK to Huawei AppGallery](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/distribution/app/agc-create_app) or you did not [create a team-level API client on AppGallery Connect](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/distribution/app/appgallerykit-createapiclient), you wonâ€™t be able to deploy the app!

If you are not familiar with how to successfully build an Android app on Bitrise, check out our documentation: [Getting started with Android apps](/getting-started/getting-started-with-android-apps/).

To configure the **Deploy to Huawei App Gallery Step**:

1. Open the Workflow Editor on Bitrise.
2. Go to the Workflow that you want to use for deploying the app.
3. Add the **Deploy to Huawei App Gallery** Step after the Steps that build and sign your APK.

4. Open the **Config** input group.
5. Fill in the required inputs.
   * **File path**: If you used a Step that automatically exports the `BITRISE_APK_PATH` Environment Variable after building your APK, leave this unchanged. The **Android Build** Step is such a Step, for example.
   * **File name**: The unique name of the APK file. This name will be used when uploading to the AppGallery Connect.
   * **App ID**: The identified can be found in the **App information** section on AppGallery Connect.
   * **Client ID**: The API client ID generated on AppGallery Connect.
   * **Key**: The key generated with the API client on AppGallery connect.

Take a look at the following bitrise.yml file to see an example configuration that uses the **Deploy to Huawei AppGallery** Step to deploy an app.

            inputs:

            - huawei_client_secret: "$CLIENT_SECRET"
            - huawei_app_id: 'YYY'  

Run a build! If all goes well, you should see your app on Huawei AppGallery.
