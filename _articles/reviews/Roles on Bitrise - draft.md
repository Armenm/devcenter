Roles are very important on Bitrise. They limit what you can and cannot do with an application. 

### Owners

There are two types of owners: **application owners** and **organization owners**. 

By the default, the owner of an application is the account that created the application. This can be either an individual user or an organization. 

### Admins

Admins can be assigned to applications, either in groups or individually. Organizations do not have admins.
