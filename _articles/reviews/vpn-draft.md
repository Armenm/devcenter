Do you require a VPN connection for your build, to be able to connect to your server,
either to `git clone` your repository or to access a private API? If yes, then this tutorial is for you!

## Technical information

To connect to a VPN, you need to:

1. Install and configure the required VPN components
2. Connect to the VPN

You can configure and connect a VPN anywhere in your Workflow - BEFORE you would use the VPN connection, of course. For example, if you require a VPN connection to access your repository, you have to connect before the `Git Clone` Step.

{% include message_box.html type="important" title="SSH sessions" content="When you choose your VPN tool and do the setup/configuration, you have to be careful **not to restart or abort** existing SSH sessions! The [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io) workers will abort the build if the SSH connection between the build's Control/Master machine and the build virtual machine terminates!"%} 

## Example

This is an example script which you can either save into your repository and run
it from there, or just copy paste its content into a `Script Step` in your `bitrise`
configuration (`bitrise.yml` / Workflow).

_You can choose other VPN tools, not just the one shown here (_[_strongswan_](https://www.strongswan.org)_), this is just one example setup which works on_ [_bitrise.io_](https://www.bitrise.io)_._
