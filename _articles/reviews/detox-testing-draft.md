Detox is a gray box end-to-end tests and automation library for mobile apps. Currently, it is only supported for iOS apps. If you have an iOS app on Bitrise, you can run Detox tests on it! It does not have to be a "native" iOS app: [our sample app](https://github.com/bitrise-samples/sample-project-react-native), for example, is a React Native project configured with Detox.
