Bitrise allows you to upload files to use in your builds; you are required to upload files for the purposes of code signing; builds also produce files as outputs. 

Uploading files to use in your build

If your build requires any files to make it work, upload them to the Generic File Storage. You can find that by opening the Workflow Editor and going to the Code signing tab. Scroll down to the Generic File Storage.
