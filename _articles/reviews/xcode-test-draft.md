Once you created your app, the first build will run based on the automatically created **primary** workflow. You can check it out in the app's [Workflow Editor](/getting-started/getting-started-workflows): click the app's name on your Dashboard then click the `Workflow` tab.

{% include message_box.html type="important" title="Test targets" content="If your app does not have test targets defined, the primary workflow will be the only automatically created workflow and it will NOT include the `Xcode Test for iOS` Step. "%}

If you have test targets defined, the `primary` workflow of an iOS app includes the two [Steps](/getting-started/getting-started-steps) you need to run your Xcode tests, and view their results on [bitrise.io](https://bitrise.io):

* `Xcode Test for iOS`
* `Deploy to Bitrise.io`

{% include message_box.html type="note" title="Code signing files" content="Running Xcode tests and deploying their results to Bitrise do not require any code signing files. So don't worry about them just yet!"%}

The `Xcode Test for iOS` step runs the pre-defined Xcode tests. It has a default configuration that does not need to be modified: if the tests are written correctly, they will work. You can find the same configuration options in Xcode, too.

The `Deploy to Bitrise.io` will deploy the following to the `Logs` and [Apps & Artifacts](/builds/build-artifacts-online/) tab of the build:

* your Xcode test results
* your raw `xcodebuildoutput` log.
