There are two types of accounts on Bitrise: individual user accounts and organization accounts. 

When signing up to Bitrise, you create an individual user account. Individual users can create their own applications or be invited to work on other applications. 

Teams on Bitrise are based on the applications: all users invited to work on a given app make up the **team** of the application. 

[Organizations are created by individual users](/team-management/organizations/creating-org/) but they need their own payment plan: even if the organization's creator is already subscribed to Bitrise, a separate payment plan must be set up for the organization itself.

|Teams |Organizations | 
|---|---|---|---|---|
|App-based|Global|
| Roles assigned by the app's admins or owners|No inherent roles: just owners and members|
|Only have access to a single app|Can own and control multiple apps|
