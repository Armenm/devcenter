There are two types of accounts on Bitrise: individual user accounts and organization accounts. 

When signing up to Bitrise, you create an individual user account. Individual users can create their own applications or be invited to work on other applications. 

[Organizations are created by individual users](/team-management/organizations/creating-org/) but they need their own payment plan: even if the organization's creator is already subscribed to Bitrise, a separate payment plan must be set up for the organization itself.
