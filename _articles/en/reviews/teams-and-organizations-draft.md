There are two types of accounts on Bitrise:

* individual user accounts
* organization accounts

When signing up to Bitrise, you create an individual user account. Individual users can create their own applications or be invited to work on other applications.

Teams on Bitrise are based on the applications: all users invited to work on a given app make up the **team** of the application. [Owners and admins can assign roles](user-roles-on-app-teams/) on the teams.

[Organizations are created by individual users](/team-management/organizations/creating-org/) but they need their own payment plan: even if the organization's creator is already subscribed to Bitrise, **a separate payment plan must be set up for the organization itself.**

| Teams | Organizations |
| --- | --- |
| App-based | Global |
| Roles assigned by the app's admins or owners | No inherent roles: just owners and members |
| Only have access to a single app | Can own and control multiple apps |

{% include message_box.html type="important" title="Teams vs groups" content="Teams and groups are not the same! [Groups are the main building blocks of organizations](/team-management/organizations/members-organizations/) but by themselves have no powers: they need to be [assigned to apps](/team-management/organizations/managing-apps/#assigning-groups-to-apps). 

Organization members can be assigned to application teams individually or as a group. The same organization group can have different roles on different application teams. "%}
