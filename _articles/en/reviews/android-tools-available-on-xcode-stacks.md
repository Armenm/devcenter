Our Xcode stacks are not exclusively for iOS apps: all Xcode stacks include Android tools, too - so you can use our Xcode stack for your cross-platform apps. 

Why should you choose this over the VS4Mac stack? That stack, formerly called the Hybrid stack, includes Xcode - but its version of Xcode is automatically upgraded from time to time. If, however, your cross-platform app requires a specific Xcode version then you should choose that particular Xcode stack. That way an Xcode upgrade will not break anything in your builds.
