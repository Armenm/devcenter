when is outside contributor allowed - user will be not able to add a contributor to the app if Outside contributors are NOT ALLOWED

Outside contributors are members of an app’s Team with a direct role, invited only to an app of an Organization and not to the Organization itself.

If you are an Owner of an Organization, you can remove members and outside contributors on the Org’s `People` tab, with one click. Owners can also remove someone from a group on the `Groups` tab. In this case the user will be removed from all apps’ team that the group is assigned to.
