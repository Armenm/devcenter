You can easily register a new Bitrise app from the Bitrise CLI: the process is guided and simple to follow. It is very similar to adding a new app on our website. 

{% include message_box.html type="note" title="My message" content=""%}

## Before you start

Before you try adding a new app to Bitrise via our CLI, make sure a few things are in order:

* You need a Bitrise account, with a connected git provider. 
* You need the Bitrise CLI: check out our [Installing and updating the Bitrise CLI](/bitrise-cli/installation/) guide. 
* Your project must have a local Git repository on your machine and a remote repository at a Git provider. 
* You need a personal access token: check out our [Generating personal access tokens manually](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/getting-started/account-security/#generating-personal-access-tokens-manually) guide.
