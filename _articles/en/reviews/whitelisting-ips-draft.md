If your servers restrict access to a limited set of IP addresses, you can add the IPs for the Bitrise build machines to those addresses.

The Android & Docker, the Xcode and the Hybrid stacks all have their own public IP addresses that need to be whitelisted. 

For the Android & Docker stacks:

* 104.197.15.74
* 35.237.165.17

For the Xcode and Hybrid stacks:

* 208.52.166.154
