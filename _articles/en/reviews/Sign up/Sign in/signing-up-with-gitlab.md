You are able to authenticate yourself with your GitLab user against **Bitrise**. It brings some practical benefits, like logging in with one click and of course you won’t have to authorize your GitLab account when adding repositories hosted by these providers again.

Signing up with email address

If you’d like to sign up with your email address, please follow the instructions in [signing up with email address](https://yv69yaruhkt48w.preview.forestry.io/getting-started/signing-up/signing-up-with-email).

Trial after signing up

If you sign up for a free account, you will automatically be granted a two-week trial on our Developer plan. This includes:

* 45 minutes of build time
* 1000 builds a month
* a maximum of 100 team members

Read more about the available plans on the [Pricing](https://www.bitrise.io/pricing/teams) page!

Select `GitLab` for authenticating yourself with this service.

## Authorize Bitrise

You have to authorize Bitrise before we can establish the connection. This means you give permission to Bitrise to access (read) your repositories.

If you press the `Authorize` button, you will be redirected to Bitrise.

## Finish signup

You will have to pick a username and a password for your Bitrise account. This way you are free from relying on the given service’s availability. You are also able to connect more accounts from other Git providers like GitHub and Bitbucket, for example.

After that, you are ready to roll.

From now on, you are able to sign in with a click of a button. Choose your favorite!
