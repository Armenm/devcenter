## Signing up with GitHub

You are able to authenticate yourself with your GitHub user against **Bitrise**. It brings some practical benefits, like logging in with one click and of course you won't have to authorize your GitHub account when adding repositories hosted by these providers again.

{% include message_box.html type="info" title="Trial after signing up" content="If you sign up for a free account, you will automatically be granted a two-week trial on our Developer plan. This includes:

* 45 minutes of build time.
* 1000 builds a month.

### Finishing signup

You will have to pick a username and a password for your Bitrise account. This way you are free from relying on the given service’s availability, you are also able to connect more accounts, GitHub **and** Bitbucket, for example. Last, but not least, you don’t have to stick to your connected account’s username.

1. Pick a username and a password for your Bitrise account on the `You are almost there` page.
