A webhook is a user-defined callback that is triggered by some event, such as pushing code to a repository. Bitrise makes extensive use of webhooks: incoming webhooks, registered with your Git service provider, are used to automatically trigger builds on Bitrise while outgoing webhooks are used to send reports of build events to other services, such as Slack.
