You can sign up to Bitrise and join a Bitrise Organization using [SAML SSO authentication](/team-management/organizations/saml-sso-in-organizations/). The Organization's SAML SSO provider adds you as a user to the SAML app/Bitrise app and you follow the instructions sent by the SAML SSO provider. The Bitrise Organization owner can send you an invitation through the [Group menu](/team-management/organizations/members-organizations/#adding-members-to-organizations) so that you know the Organization name where SAML SSO is activated 

Now let's see how to sign up to Bitrise.

1. Go to our [Sign up](https://app.bitrise.io/users/sign_up) page.
2. Click the **Sign up with SSO** button.

   You are directed to the Initiate **Single Sign-On** page.

4. Provide your credentials associated with the SAML SSO provider.
5. Check your Email and Username on the **Almost there** page.The page displays the Organization you're signing up with.
