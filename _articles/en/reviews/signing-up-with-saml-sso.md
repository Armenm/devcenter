You can sign up to Bitrise and join a Bitrise Organization using [SAML SSO authentication](/team-management/organizations/saml-sso-in-organizations/).  

There is a little preparation needed on both the SAML SSO provider's and the Bitrise Organization's side before you'd sing up. 

{% include message_box.html type="important" title="Before signing up" content="The Organization's SAML SSO provider has to first add you as a user to the Bitrise SAML SSO app's organization. Then you can follow the instructions sent by the SAML SSO provider to your email account to activate your account. To learn which Organization you should join, the Bitrise Organization owner can send you an invitation through the [Group menu](/team-management/organizations/members-organizations/#adding-members-to-organizations) of the respective Organization."%}

Now let's see how to sign up to Bitrise.

1. Go to our [Sign up](https://app.bitrise.io/users/sign_up) page.
2. Click the **Sign up with SSO** button.

   You are directed to the Initiate **Single Sign-On** page.

3. Provide the **Bitrise Organization's Name** that you got from the Bitrise Organization owner and click **Continue with SSO** so that Bitrise can direct you to Organization's connected SAML SSO provider.
4. Provide your credentials associated with the SAML SSO provider.
5. Check your Email and Username on the **Almost there** page.The page displays the Organization you're signing up with. On the **Almost there** page the Email field is automatically populated based on your email address at the SAML SSO provider side. You can alter the provided Username as you wish.
