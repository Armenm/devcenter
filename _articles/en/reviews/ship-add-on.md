## Ship overview

With Ship, you can manage Continous Deployment of your app, as well as manage different releases of the app in a convenient way. Using Ship to distribute your app gives you more control and granularity. 

You can do a whole lot of things with Ship:

* View and edit all the details of a given release, including a description, screenshots, and the most important parameters, such as the app size or the supported device types. 
* Install a given release directly from the Ship page for testing, or share it with a third party.
* Quickly deploy a given release to all applicable online stores, once you set up publishing.
