## About GitHub Checks

Bitrise's GitHub Checks is an integrated tool to provide an extended version of the classic status checks we send back to GitHub once a build has run. With the GitHub Checks toggle enabled you can have access to a more detailed summary of the CI run results and annotate lines in the code that has some issues/errors.
