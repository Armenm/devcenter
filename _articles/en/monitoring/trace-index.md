Trace is a Bitrise add-on designed to monitor your applications from the perspective of its end users. It comes with out-of-the-box performance monitoring, giving you insight into how the app is performing across the entire install base.

The core philosophy of Trace is to simplify how mobile product teams:

* Detect the problem: know about issues before your users report them.
* Assess the impact: focus on resolving the issues that have the greatest impact on your users.
* Trace the cause: spend less time trying to reproduce issues.
